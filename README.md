Just type in any food you want, and a bunch of recipes will pop up for you to choose from that will include Calories, Cuisine Type, Ingredients and a preview of the delicious meal you will be consuming! 

On top of all this goodness, you will also receive a inspirational quote to brighten your day!

a inspirational quote followed by various recipes for your item.
